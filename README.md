# AT2024
## This repo is being provided for attendees of Anthology Together 2024.
The docker-compose in this repo can be used to quickly spin up an Apache/PHP/MariaDB environment, configured to use an external folder for the web folder.  This makes developing custom Tsugi modules much faster and easier, as there's no need to rebuild the container following every change.  Any changes to files in the public_html folder are live immediately.

Please note - there is no support provided for the use of this repo, or any of the files contained within.  Use at your own risk!
